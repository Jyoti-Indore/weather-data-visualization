Weather Data Analysis and Visualization Project Report
# 🌦️ Weather Data Visualization Project

This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of real-world weather data using Python. The analysis was performed in **Google Colab** with libraries like **Pandas** and **Seaborn**, and the final report was documented in **IEEE format using Overleaf**.

📄 The complete analysis and visualizations are available in the attached PDF report.

## 📌 Project Overview

- Explored a weather dataset with 14,000+ records covering temperature, humidity, air pollution, wind speed, visibility, and weather type.
- Focused on understanding the relationship between key environmental attributes like humidity and temperature.
- Used a range of visualizations to present insights:
  - Bar plots
  - Joint plots (scatter, hexbin, KDE)
  - Pair plots
  - Count plots and strip plots
  - Linear regression models (lm plots)
